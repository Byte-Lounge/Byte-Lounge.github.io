## About us

This Discord Server is a great place to find out how to ethically hack!  
This server was made so that other people could learn how to ethically hack, how to further develop knowledge or fancy a challenge and join our capture the flag(CTF) team and win prizes.  
We enjoy challenges and happy to give tips to people that are stuck on problems.  
We find great satisfaction in achieving challenges as a team.
